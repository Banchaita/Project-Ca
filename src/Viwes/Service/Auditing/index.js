                Auditing is a systematic process aimed at evaluating the
                effectiveness of an organizationâ€™s internal controls, risk
                management, and governance processes to ensure compliance with
                laws, regulations, and internal policies. The scope of an audit
                can vary widely, encompassing financial records, operational
                procedures, and IT systems, depending on the objectives set
                forth by the auditing body. Methodologically, it involves a
                combination of document review, interviews, observation, and
                testing of controls. Key findings from an audit typically
                highlight areas of non-compliance, inefficiencies, or potential
                risks, along with their root causes. Based on these findings,
                auditors provide recommendations to improve processes, mitigate
                risks, and enhance overall organizational performance. The
                conclusion of the audit reflects the overall health of the
                audited areas and outlines steps for corrective action, thereby
                providing a roadmap for continuous improvement and assurance to
                stakeholders.
